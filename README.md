## This is a test example
Uses laravel, and a VueJs SPA

To run, clone the repo and:
- Install the dependencies with `composer install`
- Run `php artisan serve` to boot the local server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000

The database used is sqlite.
All settings are set to dev or included in the app config so no need for an .env file
